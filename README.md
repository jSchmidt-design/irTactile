![Image description](app_screenshot.png)

irTactile is a tool designed to generate audio output to drive bass shakers using telemetry data provided by racing simulators.

Initially the goal was to provide the most realistic suspension effects, but in the mean time a full set effects is available:
1. Suspension\
  Highly realistic signal based on suspension telemetry
2. ABS\
  Basic ABS vibration. Vibration frequency can be configured per car
3. Engine Vibrations\
  Simple simulation of inline engine. Number of cylinders and some tuning parameters configurable per car.
4. Gear Shifting\
  Basic Gear Shift emulation. Shift times can be configured per car. 
5. Slip (Experimental)\
  Emulation of slip signal (over steer/ under steer). Similar to the tyre sound generated by iRacing. Requires per car specific configuration. Only few cars are enabled at the moment. 

With version 0.4.0 irTactile can be used for the following simulators
* iRacing
* "Automobilista 2"
* "Le Mans Ultimate"

The big advantages if irTactile compared with other application is:
- Very realistic suspension signal
- Ultra low latency
- Extreme flexibility to compose the final signal
- Built in filters which make external (hardware/software) solutions obsolete
- Supports for sound cards with more than 8 channels
- The application is ASIO compatible

NOTE: The application is in a very early alpha phase. Please do not expect that everything is working perfectly. 

# Concept

The basic idea of irTactile is to take the telemetry data offered by the simulator and convert it in a set of audio streams. 
The audio streams can then be mixed and processed by various audio filters before being send to a specific channel of the sound card.

# irTactile Documentation
irTactile can be executed in three different modes:

1. Live Mode\
   In this mode the application waits for an active iRacing sessions. iRacing has to be running and the car must be on track. 
2. Replay Mode (Demo mode checked and replay file selected)\
   In this mode an output will be generated based on a pre recorded file. iRacing is not required to run.
3. Demo mode (Demo mode checked and no replay file selected)\
   In this mode only output based on the "static" wave files is generated. All other signals are zero. 

## Getting Started

Running irTactile is straightforward. 

1. **Extract the application**
2. **Select the Audio Driver**\
   When irTactile is executed for the first time, a prompt will open to select the device or Editor can be used.
3. **Use irTactile_editor to assign the outputs to the channels and select the operation mode**
4. **Run irTactile**\
   Can be started directly or from the editor

**Important: irTactile can potentially generate signals which can damage a shaker**

- Make sure that audio device is configured correctly. See the buffer configuration chapter for details.
- Test first without amplifiers/shakers connected. 
- Make sure that the signals shown in the preview screen look good/reasonable.
- When everything looks good connect the amps/shakers and slowly increase volume.
- If not using a prebuilt profile, it is best to start from scratch and slowly improve the setup.
  - Start with suspension. 
    - Depending on configuration go with front/back configuration or mix all 4 suspension signals.
    - Apply LP/HP filters which are matching the used shakers
    - Adjust the gain.
  - Add Gear
  - Add Engine


## Device Selection
When you start irTactile.exe for the first time, you will be prompted to select the output device. To re-run the configuration you have to delete device_config.json in the root directory.
Alternatively you can launch device configuration from the editor in the "Devices" section as well. 

First step of the configuration process is to select the driver. 

For consumer grade devices in general "WASAPI" should be selected. With version 0.4.0 also ASIO compatible devices can be used directly. 

![Image description](device_selection_ui.png)

In a second step the actual device can be selected. For irTactile the device needs to support 48k sampling rate. If you select a device which shows a different number, irTactile will try to open the device with 48k anyhow. If this is not supported by the device, the application will terminate. In this case the sampling rate should be changed in windows settings.  

![Image description](device_selection_ui2.png)

In the last some device parameters can be configured. Check Output Device Tuning for more details.

## Simulator Selection

Select the simulator which should be used as data source. Available options are:

- iRacing
- Le Mans Ultimate 
- Automobilista 2

Whenever switching the simulator, irTactile has to be restarted. 

## Channel Mapping

![Image description](channel_assignment.png)

irTactile works like an audio mixer console. To get any output the available audio sources have to be routed to a channel of a specific audio device. 
Even if there is only one physical device configured it is possible to define multiple channel mappings. But only the mapping which points to the currently configured audio device will be active. This allows simple switching between the mappings i.e. for testing without actually modifying the real mapping. 

Channel mapping not only allows to route a stream to a channel. It is also possible to apply filters and or mix multiple audio streams. More details are provided in the Audio Mixer section. 

When mixing multiple streams the gain factors should be selected in a way that the individual streams are present in the final mix with the desired intensity while maintaining the overall signal strength at a reasonable level without introducing clipping. 


Out of the box the following streams are provided:
- **ABS_HR.\***: ABS signal.

Additional streams can be created in the Audio Mixer or by defining static streams. 

**It is possible to provide more mappings than the channel number of the device. Again make sure that the real channels are referenced only once.**


## Audio Mixer 
![Image description](audio_streams.png)

Audio Mixer allows creation of additional streams. Each stream is a mix of any other combination of input streams and filters. 

Filters can be assigned to the individual streams and globally for the final output. 

## Audio Filter 
![Image description](Filter.png) 

As of now the following filters can be used to modify the stream:
- **Low Pass**: 2nd order Butterworth. Gain reduction -3db at cutoff frequency.
- **High Pass**: 2nd order Butterworth. Gain reduction -3db at cutoff frequency.
- **Peaking Filter**: In case the final mix might have peaks beyond the clipping range, this can be used to bring the peaks down without having to reduce the volume overall. 
  - **Frequency**: Center frequency.
  - **Q Factor**: Q controls the width/steepness of the filter.
  - **Gain**: Boost/Cut.
- **EQ**: An Equalizer based on multiple peaking filters. REW generated filter can be directly imported.
- **Limiter**: In case the final mix might have peaks beyond the clipping range, this can be used to bring the peaks down without having to reduce the volume overall. 
  - **Threshold**
    Controls when limiter starts working
  - **Gain**
    Controls how much the gain should be reduced in case the signal is above the threshold
- **Compressor**:  
  - **Threshold**
    TBD
  - **Attack**
    TBD
  - **Release**
    TBD
  - **Gain**
    TBD
- **Gate**: Filters our signal below threshold. 
  - **Threshold**
    TBD
  - **Attack**
    TBD
  - **Release**
    TBD
  - **Gain**
    TBD
- **Gamma**: Applies a gamma correction to the signal. As this is a non linear transformation, distortion is introduced.
Values >1 will reduce the output volume of low amplitudes. Values < 1 will increase the output for low amplitudes.
- **Modulate**: Allows to modulate the input signal with a second signal. 
- **WaveSynth**: Generate a sinus wave based on the input signal.
- **Sigmoid**: Similar to Gamma correction this filters allows to change the dynamic range of the input signal. As this is a non linear transformation distortion is introduced. The shape of the response function can be controlled with three parameters:
  -  **k**
    Controls the steepness 
  -  **a**
    Controls the symmetry
  -  **x0**
    Controls the mid point


Filters can be activated/deactivated individually or the whole filter chain can turned on/off.
  
## Custom Sources
![Image description](static_waves.png)

In addition to custom mixes it is also possible to define static sinus wave which can be used as audio sources in any mix. 
Three types of sources are supported:
- **Sine waves**: Basic Sine wave.
- **Sweeps**: Three different sweeps can be selected.
  -  Sweep with constant amplitude
  -  Sweep with constant velocity
  -  Sweep with constant acceleration
- **Noise**: Pink/White Noise.
- **Wav File**: Allows to play back a wav file. Only files with a sampling rate of 48Khz are supported.
- 
## Output Device Tuning
After the initial device selection basic settings are applied which should work on most systems but thy are not offering the lowest possible latency. 

irTactile provides the following tuning parameters:
- Exclusive Mode (when WASAPI is being used)
  - If enabled:
    - Windows internal mixer is by-passed
    - All audio enhancements are disabled (i.e. Equalizer APO)
    - Audio volume is only controlled by irTactile
  - Not supported by all devices
- Device Buffer Size
- Buffer Multiplier
- Latency Compensation

![Image description](device_options.png)

To achieve the lowest possible latency it is best to use ASIO if supported by the device. Second best option is WASAPI in exclusive mode. 

Next step is to identify the lowest possible buffers sizes. The simplest solution is to connect head phones or loudspeakers to the sound card, route an audible test signal the correct channel and then observe the output. 

### Device Buffer Tuning

Especially for ASIO devices it is important to select the correct device buffer size. But it applies to WASAPI mode as well.

1. Enable Demo Mode
2. Configure a Simple Wav file with 50 Hz 
3. Launch a game to simulate real system load
4. Listen to the output

Start with a buffer size of 32. If there are clicking noises repeat with the next higher size. 

Important: For ASIO this number should be the same as it is configured for the output device in the ASIO driver. On some deviced this is setup  automatically when changing the buffer size in irTactile. Other devices require to set the buffer size manually.  

### Application Buffer Tuning

In a second step the application internal buffer size has to be selected. The is configured as a multiple of the device buffer size. 

1. Enable Regular Mode
2. Configure a Simple Wav file with 50 Hz 
3. Launch a game
4. Listen to the output

The goal is to keep the buffer size as low as possible without introducing any clicking noises. A good starting point is a total buffer size at least 3 times the buffer size but not bigger than 400 bytes.
I.e. If device buffer is 32, multiplicator 10 can be used. If device buffer is 64 a multiplicator of 5 can be used.  

If there are clicking noises the buffer multiplicator has to be increased. If the output is clean the multiplicator can be reduced as long as there are no clicking noises. 

If the total buffer needs to be increased above 400 byte, "Latency Compensation" can be enabled. For ASIO the values need to be kept very low 10%-20%. For WASAPI 10%-50% can be a valid range. But this has to be tested for each sound card individually    


## Car specific configuration

As soon as a car is driven for the first time a default configuration file will be created. The individual parameters can be adjusted in the cars section of the editor.

- **Gear Shift**
  - Shift Time: Controls the length of the shift impulse in milliseconds
  - Intensity: Controls the volume of the signal in dB
- **Engine**
  - Cylinder: Number of cylinders to be used for simulation
  - Pressure: Controls how the engine behaves under load. Lower values result in a rougher vibrations
  - Intensity: Controls the volume of the signal in dB
- **Suspension**
  - Max Acceleration: Defines the acceleration value of the impact on the suspension which will be mapped to max signal strength
  - Min Velocity: All suspension movements below the value will be ignored. 
  - Gamma: Values smaller 1 will amplify low movements. Values bigger 1 will reduce signal strength of small impacts
- **g Force**
  - Max longitudinal force:  Defines the acceleration value which will be mapped to max signal strength in g
  - Max lateral force: Defines the acceleration value which will be mapped to max signal strength in g
  - Max vertical force: Defines the acceleration value which will be mapped to max signal strength in g
- **Slip**
  - Max oversteer angle: Defines the oversteer angle in degrees which will be mapped to max signal strength
  - Max understeer angle: Defines the oversteer angle in degrees which will be mapped to max signal strength
  - Slip Factor: Magic number controls the zero point 
  - Slip Intensity: Controls the volume of the signal in dB
- **ABS Settings**
  - Frequency: Abs frequency in Hz
  - Intensity: Volume of the signal in dB

## Troubleshooting
 - After device selection, application exists immediately after start.
   Something wrong with the selected device.
    - Please delete `device_config.json` and choose a valid device.
 - No UI.
   Either the window has been disabled or moved in strange position.
    - Try deleting `config.json`.
- No signal 
  - Check if Demo Mode is active.
  - Check if Channel mapping points to the correct device. 
- No sound signal even though demo mode is active
  - In demo mode only simple waves can be played. I.e. (TestSignal50Hz) 
- Soundblaster z SE not working in WASAPI exclusive mode.
  - Known issue with this sound card. Do not activate exclusive mode. 
- Changes in the editor are not reflected.
  - Make sure that "auto save" feature is enabled.
  - Changing device settings requires a restart of irTactile.
  - Check if there are multiple mappings to the same channel.
